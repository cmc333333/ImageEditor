It is a simple image manipulation application, allowing colors to be inverted,
images to be blurred, etc. Load an image then drag to make a selection.

Next, clone this repository into a folder named "ImageEditor". From one
directory above (i.e. the parent of the "ImageEditor" folder), execute:

```
/path/to/processing-java --sketch=ImageEditor --run
```
